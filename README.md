# css-fundamentals

Completed the CSS one shot from "Apna College" and now I can say that I am very much confident at CSS. You don't require to master the CSS but this tutorial gives complete knowledge that how the CSS is applied and flow of the styling in a web page. It's a great tutorial for absolute beginners and broken down into levels.

In my opinion you should be very focused while watching this tutorial and should get your hands dirty for Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4. Level 5 is optional for absolute beginners. You can do that later. Don't focus on learning too much. You should focus to learn the minimum thing and then start building something on your own. Then you wil be able to identify mistakes and also this will be very much helpful to build muscle memory.
